## What's this app?
IlluMefy is a cross-platform mobile application (iOS/Android) developed by MikhailHal.  
It helps users discover gaming creators through community-driven tagging (folksonomy).  
Its key feature is allowing users to add tags to creators, creating a collective intelligence system for finding content creators.  
The reason for developing it is to offer more authentic, personalized ways to discover creators beyond algorithmic recommendations.  
Discovery Through Community Wisdom
IlluMefy harnesses the power of folksonomy - a collaborative tagging system where users collectively categorize content. The name "IlluMefy" combines "Illuminate" (to shed light on) with "Me" and "-fy" (to extend to others), reflecting our mission to illuminate both your preferences and the wider community's wisdom.

## üåü Key Features

* Folksonomy-Based Discovery: Find gaming creators based on community tags, not algorithms or paid promotions
* Personalized Recommendations: Discover content creators who match your specific interests and play style
* Community-Driven Tags: Add meaningful tags to creators and help others find exactly what they're looking for
* Tag Exploration: Browse popular tags to discover new creators across different games, styles, and content types
* Intuitive Interface: Navigate seamlessly through our clean, modern design in both light and dark modes

## üöÄ Our Vision
IlluMefy is more than just an app - it's a movement toward more authentic, community-driven content discovery. We believe in offering continuous excellent experiences to people around the world through our own technologies.

## üîç Current Status
IlluMefy has been developing by MikhailHal.  
I will launch this app as beta version soon!!
